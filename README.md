# Danielle Myung - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Danielle! I have an operations management background in hospitality and currently, I am on track to obtaining my Masters in Applied Analytics at Columbia University. I have a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and using visualization tools to convey insights to audiences with all technical backgrounds. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy playing board games, trail running, and playing with my 3 cats!
